                We focus on the purity and beauty of simple shapes, textures and
                forms, designing candles as objects, not scent. Functional
                pieces with the stylistic impact of sculptures, our candles are
                shape-shifting objects that transform from one form into the
                next as they slowly burn down.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good quality candle can be recognised by the way it burns. Our
                candles have a slow, calm and even burn, with a steady flame
                that burns the wax all the way down. This means our candles burn
                longer, cleaner and brighter.
